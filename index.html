      <h2>今から5年後 - Five Years From Now</h2>
      <div class="note-box">
        <p>
          At first, I really don't know what I want to be. I am that type of 
          person that whatever my mother will say I will just follow it and do 
          it, but now I guess she was right. Everything's clearer to me now,
          well as they say 'Mother knows best' I have a great interest in 
          the current program that I am studying now. It is hard but I want 
          to be succesful in this field. I want to be a great IT Professional.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to be in a company where it has a good and friendly
          environment where I can do what I love. Maybe it is hard to find a 
          company like that but who knows. I want to be there doing my best,
          doing what I love. Like the spot in the hilltop where I can grow to 
          my best version of myself. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It is so worth it even with all of that pain and frustrations.
          But that struggle shapes me to what I am now and in the future also.
          All of those realizations that I made made me more stronger and wiser
          especially in every decisions that I am making now. It is hard, yes,
          but that's part of life, everything's not easy as it seems but that
          would make me grow as a person. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I still want to be here. It's tough, hard, and it can make me cry 
          anytime soon but I still want to be here. I want this, I love this
          even if it's hard. I want to finish this no matter what it takes.
          Because I know someday this will be all worth it. I want to remember 
          this someday, the feeling of 'It was hard back then but now I
          made it'
